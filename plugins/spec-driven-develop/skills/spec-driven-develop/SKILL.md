# Spec-Driven Develop

You are executing the **Spec-Driven Development** workflow — a standardized pre-development pipeline for large-scale complex tasks. Your job is to complete all preparation phases before any actual coding begins, ensuring the project has full analysis, a clear plan, trackable progress documents, and a task-specific SKILL.

## Configuration

| Path               | Default Value                | Purpose                                    |
|:-------------------|:-----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------|
| Analysis output    | `docs/analysis/`             | Phase 1 analysis documents                 |
| Plan output        | `docs/plan/`                 | Phase 3 planning documents                 |
| Progress output    | `docs/progress/`             | Phase 4 tracking documents (incl. MASTER.md) |
| Archive output     | `docs/archives/<project>/`   | Phase 7 archived artifacts                 |
| Sub-SKILL install  | Project level (auto-detect)  | Platform-specific: `.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, or project-local |
| Task tracking mode | Auto-detect                  | `GITHUB_FULL`, `GITHUB_STANDARD`, or `LOCAL_ONLY` (see below) |

Templates for all generated documents are in `references/templates/`. Behavioral rules are in `references/behavioral-rules.md`. The parallel execution protocol is in `references/parallel-protocol.md`. The GitHub integration protocol is in `references/github-integration.md`.

### Task Tracking Modes

The workflow supports three task tracking modes, auto-detected via a pre-flight check in Phase 1:

| Mode | Requirements | Capabilities |
|:-----|:------------|:-------------|
| **GITHUB_FULL** (default) | `gh` CLI + auth + `project` scope | Issues + Milestones + Labels + Project board + worktree + PR |
| **GITHUB_STANDARD** (auto-fallback) | `gh` CLI + auth + `repo` scope | Issues + Milestones + Labels + worktree + PR (no board) |
| **LOCAL_ONLY** (fallback) | None | Original local-file workflow |

See `references/github-integration.md` for the full protocol, `gh` command reference, and Issue body template.

## Before You Begin: Cross-Conversation Continuity Check

**CRITICAL**: Before starting any phase, check if `docs/progress/MASTER.md` already exists in the project.

- If it **exists**: Read it immediately. You are resuming an in-progress task. Identify the **tracking mode** (`GITHUB_FULL`, `GITHUB_STANDARD`, or `LOCAL_ONLY`) from the `Mode` field, which phase you are in, what has been completed, and continue from the exact point where the previous conversation left off. Do NOT restart from Phase 0.
  - **If mode is GITHUB_FULL or GITHUB_STANDARD**: Also query GitHub for the latest task status, since Issues may have been closed (via merged PRs) since the last session. Use the commands in `references/github-integration.md` § "Reading Progress from GitHub". Update MASTER.md if the GitHub state is ahead of the local index.
- If it **does not exist**: This is a fresh start. Proceed to Phase 0.

After loading your current state, populate the platform's native task tracking tool (e.g. TodoWrite) with the active phase's pending tasks. For each task, set content to the task description, status to "in-progress" for the currently active task and "todo" for the rest, and priority mapped as P0=high, P1=medium, P2=low. This gives the user real-time visual progress in their IDE. If no native task tool is available, skip this step — MASTER.md alone is sufficient.

---

## Phase 0: Quick Intent Capture

**Goal**: Capture the user's high-level transformation direction in 1-2 sentences — just enough to give Phase 1 analysis a focus, without deep clarification.

**Actions**:

1. Extract the big-picture direction from the user's message:
   - The type of transformation (language migration, framework change, architecture overhaul, new feature development, etc.)
   - The rough target state (e.g., "rewrite in Rust", "migrate to microservices")
   - Any constraints or preferences the user explicitly mentioned

2. Summarize the direction back to the user in 1-2 sentences. Do NOT ask deep clarifying questions at this stage — the analysis in Phase 1 will reveal the project reality needed for informed questions. Simply confirm: "I understand you want to [direction]. Let me first analyze the current project so I can ask you the right questions."

3. If the user's intent is completely unclear (e.g., they said something vague like "improve this project"), ask ONE high-level question to determine the transformation type. Keep it brief.

**Output**: A preliminary direction statement that guides Phase 1's analysis focus. This is NOT the final task definition — that comes in Phase 2 after analysis.

---

## Phase 1: Deep Project Analysis

**Goal**: Build a comprehensive understanding of the current codebase, informed by the preliminary direction from Phase 0.

**Actions**:

1. Launch `project-analyzer` sub-agents **in parallel** to analyze the codebase concurrently. Split the work by focus area:
   - **Agent 1 — Architecture & Stack**: Project structure, directory layout, technology stack, entry points, build/run commands
   - **Agent 2 — Module Inventory**: Each module's responsibility, public API surface, size, internal/external dependencies. **Must evaluate each module against all five S.U.P.E.R principles** (Single Purpose, Unidirectional Flow, Ports over Implementation, Environment-Agnostic, Replaceable Parts) and assign a per-principle compliance rating.
   - **Agent 3 — Risks & S.U.P.E.R Health**: Transformation risks, complexity hotspots, platform-specific code, coding conventions. **Must produce a S.U.P.E.R Architecture Health Summary** evaluating the overall codebase against each principle, identifying violation hotspots that become priority targets in the transformation plan.

   Provide each agent with the preliminary direction from Phase 0 AND `references/super-philosophy.md` so they can assess findings against S.U.P.E.R principles in context of the intended transformation.

   If sub-agents are not available on the current platform, perform the analysis sequentially yourself — the scope is the same either way.

2. Consolidate agent outputs and resolve any contradictions or gaps. Write analysis documents to `docs/analysis/` using the templates in `references/templates/analysis.md`:
   - `project-overview.md` — Architecture, tech stack, entry points, build system
   - `module-inventory.md` — Every module with: responsibility, dependencies, size, complexity rating, **S.U.P.E.R compliance score per module**
   - `risk-assessment.md` — Technical risks, compatibility risks, complexity hotspots, **S.U.P.E.R Architecture Health Summary with violation hotspots**

3. **GitHub Pre-flight Check**: Run the pre-flight detection from `references/github-integration.md` § "Pre-flight Check" to determine the task tracking mode (`GITHUB_FULL`, `GITHUB_STANDARD`, or `LOCAL_ONLY`). Report the detected mode to the user. If the mode is not what they expect, explain what's missing and how to upgrade (e.g., `gh auth refresh -s project`).

**Output**: Complete `docs/analysis/` directory with three documents. The S.U.P.E.R assessment serves as the architectural baseline for all subsequent phases. The detected GitHub integration mode is communicated to the user.

---

## Phase 2: Intent Refinement & Confirmation

**Goal**: With the project fully analyzed, engage the user in a grounded, high-quality discussion to finalize the task definition. The analysis from Phase 1 enables asking precise, informed questions that would have been impossible before understanding the codebase.

**Actions**:

1. Present key findings from Phase 1 as context for the discussion:
   - Brief architecture summary (how the project is structured today)
   - Notable S.U.P.E.R health issues (violation hotspots, architectural risks)
   - Module coupling and complexity highlights relevant to the intended transformation

2. Ask the user **targeted clarifying questions grounded in the analysis**. These should be specific and informed, not generic. Examples of the quality expected:
   - "Module A and Module B are tightly coupled with circular dependencies. Do you want to decouple them as part of this migration, or preserve the current structure?"
   - "The risk assessment shows 3 modules with hardcoded environment assumptions. Should we fix these (aligning with S.U.P.E.R E principle) or defer that to a separate task?"
   - "The current codebase has no interface contracts between modules. Do you want to introduce schema-defined boundaries (S.U.P.E.R P principle) during this transformation?"

   At minimum, confirm:
   - **Scope**: Which parts of the project are in scope? Reference specific modules from the inventory.
   - **Target**: Confirm the target technology/architecture/state, now informed by current architecture reality.
   - **Constraints**: Hard constraints (timeline, backward compatibility, specific libraries, deployment targets)?
   - **Priorities**: What matters most — performance, maintainability, feature parity, or something else? Reference the risk assessment to help the user prioritize.
   - **S.U.P.E.R priorities**: Which architectural violations should be fixed during this transformation vs. deferred?

3. Summarize the refined understanding back to the user and get explicit confirmation before proceeding.

**Output**: A clear, confirmed task definition grounded in project reality. This is the authoritative task definition that guides all subsequent phases (Phase 3-7).

---

## Phase 3: Task Decomposition

**Goal**: Break down the transformation into manageable, trackable tasks organized in phases, with explicit parallel execution lanes.

**Actions**:

1. Launch `task-architect` sub-agents with the full analysis output from Phase 1 AND the confirmed task definition from Phase 2 — including the S.U.P.E.R health assessment from `risk-assessment.md`. If the project is large enough to warrant multiple strategies, launch 2 agents exploring different decomposition approaches (e.g., bottom-up vs. strangler fig) and pick the better result.

   If sub-agents are not available, perform the decomposition yourself.

2. The decomposition must produce:
   - Phased approach with natural phase boundaries, ordered by dependency. **Early phases should prioritize fixing S.U.P.E.R violation hotspots** identified in Phase 1, establishing clean architecture foundations before building new features.
   - Concrete tasks for each phase, each with: description, priority (P0/P1/P2), effort (S/M/L/XL), dependencies, **S.U.P.E.R design drivers** (which principles are most relevant), acceptance criteria. **Every task's acceptance criteria implicitly includes passing the S.U.P.E.R Quick Check for its listed principles.**
   - **Parallel execution lanes**: For each phase, group tasks that have no mutual dependencies into lanes that can run simultaneously. Assess merge risk (file overlap) between lanes.
   - Dependency graph as a Mermaid diagram — use subgraphs to visualize parallel lanes
   - Milestones at natural phase boundaries

3. Write planning documents to `docs/plan/` using the templates in `references/templates/plan.md`:
   - `task-breakdown.md` — All phases and tasks with full detail, including parallel lane assignments and **S.U.P.E.R design constraints**
   - `dependency-graph.md` — Mermaid diagram showing task/phase dependencies and parallel lanes
   - `milestones.md` — Milestone definitions with target criteria

4. **GitHub Resource Synchronization** (skip if `LOCAL_ONLY` mode):

   After writing the local plan documents, create the corresponding GitHub resources. Follow the commands and templates in `references/github-integration.md`. Execute in this order:

   a. **Create Labels** — priority, size, phase, lane, and `spec-driven` labels (idempotent with `--force`)
   b. **Create Milestones** — one per Phase, via `gh api` REST call
   c. **Create Issues** — one per task, using the Issue body template from `references/github-integration.md`. Assign labels and milestone. Add a 1-second delay between creations to avoid rate limits.
   d. **[GITHUB_FULL only] Create Project board** — create the Project, link it to the repo, create custom fields (Priority, Size, Phase), and add all Issues to the board. If custom field value assignment fails, log a warning and continue — the Labels already carry the same information.

   After creation, record all GitHub resource URLs (Project URL, Milestone URLs, Issue number mapping) — these are needed for MASTER.md in Phase 4.

**Output**: Complete `docs/plan/` directory with three documents. Every task is annotated with its S.U.P.E.R design drivers. In GitHub modes, all tasks also exist as GitHub Issues with Labels and Milestones.

---

## Phase 4: Progress Tracking Documentation

**Goal**: Create a progress tracking system that survives across conversations. The format depends on the detected tracking mode.

**Actions**:

Use the templates in `references/templates/progress.md` for all progress documents.

### In GITHUB_FULL or GITHUB_STANDARD mode:

1. Create the **master index file** `docs/progress/MASTER.md` as a **lightweight GitHub index** with:
   - Task name and description (from Phase 2)
   - **Tracking mode** (`GITHUB_FULL` or `GITHUB_STANDARD`)
   - **Repository** identifier (`owner/repo`)
   - **GitHub Project URL** (GITHUB_FULL only)
   - Links to each analysis and plan document
   - **Milestone table**: Phase name → Milestone URL → open/closed counts
   - **Issue mapping table**: Task ID → Issue number → status
   - A "Quick Status Commands" section with ready-to-run `gh` commands for querying live progress
   - A "Current Status" section indicating which phase/task is active
   - A "Next Steps" section for the agent to quickly orient itself

   The MASTER.md in GitHub mode does NOT duplicate task details — those live in the GitHub Issues. It serves as a local index and entry point for cross-conversation continuity.

2. **Per-phase detail files are optional** in GitHub mode. The phase's task list lives in GitHub Issues filtered by milestone. If you create them, keep them lightweight — just a list of Issue references, not full task descriptions.

### In LOCAL_ONLY mode:

1. Create the **master control file** `docs/progress/MASTER.md` with:
   - Task name and description (from Phase 2)
   - **Tracking mode**: `LOCAL_ONLY`
   - Link to each analysis document
   - Link to each plan document
   - A summary table of all phases with completion percentage
   - Links to each phase's detailed progress file
   - A "Current Status" section indicating which phase/task is active
   - A "Next Steps" section for the agent to quickly orient itself

2. Create **one detailed progress file per phase**: `docs/progress/phase-N-<short-name>.md`
   - Each file contains the phase's tasks as checkbox items: `- [ ] Task description`
   - Include acceptance criteria inline for each task
   - Include a "Notes" section for recording decisions, blockers, and context

### Common to all modes:

3. The MASTER.md format must follow these conventions:
   - Phases use the format: `- [ ] Phase N: <name> (0/X tasks)` with a link to either the phase file (LOCAL_ONLY) or the milestone URL (GitHub modes)
   - When a phase is fully done: `- [x] Phase N: <name> (X/X tasks)`
   - The "Current Status" section is updated by the agent at the start and end of each work session

**Output**: Complete `docs/progress/` directory with MASTER.md (and per-phase detail files in LOCAL_ONLY mode).

---

## Phase 5: Task-Specific Sub-SKILL Generation

**Goal**: Create a project-level SKILL tailored to this specific task, encoding the interaction patterns and development standards needed for the actual implementation work.

**Actions**:

1. The sub-SKILL is **always installed at project level** (e.g., `.cursor/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`, or project-local directory). Do not ask the user for installation location. This keeps the sub-SKILL co-located with the project it serves and avoids polluting the global skill space.

2. Determine what the sub-SKILL should contain (see `references/templates/sub-skill.md` for the full content outline):
   - **S.U.P.E.R architecture principles — MUST be inlined verbatim**, not merely referenced. The executing agent may not have access to `references/super-philosophy.md`, so the full five principles with litmus tests must be embedded directly in the sub-SKILL body. This is the #1 most important section.
   - **S.U.P.E.R Code Review Checklist** — a 10-point checklist that the agent must run after completing every task, before marking it as done. Include the scoring rule: all pass = proceed, 1-2 fail = fix first, 3+ fail = stop and refactor.
   - Task-specific coding standards and conventions for the target technology, **framed through S.U.P.E.R principles** (e.g., error handling aligned with U, dependency injection aligned with P, config management aligned with E)
   - The cross-conversation continuity protocol (read MASTER.md first)
   - Project-specific architecture context, including the **S.U.P.E.R violation hotspots** from `docs/analysis/risk-assessment.md` that must be addressed
   - Guidance on how to update progress documents after completing each task
   - Phase-specific instructions relevant to the transformation type
   - **Parallel execution protocol**: reference `references/parallel-protocol.md` for the full protocol
   - The archive trigger: when all tasks are done, initiate Phase 7

3. **Delegate creation to the platform's native skill-creator**:
   - On **Claude Code** or **Codex**: Invoke the platform's built-in `skill-creator` skill, providing it with the task context, the desired skill name, description, and content outline. Let the native tool handle the actual file generation and installation.
   - On **Cursor**: If a skill-creator skill is available, use it. Otherwise, create the SKILL.md directly following the standard frontmatter + markdown format and place it in the project's skills directory.

4. The generated sub-SKILL should instruct the agent to:
   - Always read `docs/progress/MASTER.md` at the start of every conversation
   - **Check the tracking mode** and follow the appropriate workflow:
     - **GitHub modes**: Read the next pending Issue from GitHub, execute in a worktree, create a PR with `closes #N`, and comment on the Issue. Progress is tracked via Issue state (open/closed).
     - **LOCAL_ONLY mode**: Read the next pending task from the phase file, execute it, update checkboxes.
   - **Run the S.U.P.E.R Code Review Checklist** after completing each task, before marking it done
   - Update the "Current Status" section in MASTER.md at the start and end of each session
   - When all tasks are complete (all Issues closed or all checkboxes checked), trigger Phase 7 (Archive)

**Output**: A project-level task-specific SKILL.

---

## Phase 6: Handoff & Summary

**Goal**: Present all preparation artifacts to the user and confirm readiness to begin development.

**Actions**:

1. Present a structured summary to the user:
   - Task definition (from Phase 2)
   - Key findings from analysis (high-level, from Phase 1)
   - Phased plan overview with task counts (from Phase 3)
   - **Tracking mode** and what it means for the execution workflow
   - Progress tracking system description (from Phase 4)
   - Sub-SKILL name and installation location (from Phase 5)

2. List all generated artifacts:
   - `docs/analysis/project-overview.md`
   - `docs/analysis/module-inventory.md`
   - `docs/analysis/risk-assessment.md`
   - `docs/plan/task-breakdown.md`
   - `docs/plan/dependency-graph.md`
   - `docs/plan/milestones.md`
   - `docs/progress/MASTER.md`
   - `docs/progress/phase-N-*.md` (LOCAL_ONLY mode, one per phase)
   - The generated sub-SKILL
   - **[GitHub modes]** GitHub Project URL, Milestone URLs, list of created Issue numbers

3. Ask the user: "All preparation is complete. Ready to begin Phase 1 development?"

**Output**: User confirmation to proceed with actual implementation.

---

## Phase 7: Archive

**Trigger**: This phase activates when ALL tasks are complete — all Issues closed (GitHub modes) or all checkboxes marked `[x]` (LOCAL_ONLY mode).

**Goal**: Archive all workflow artifacts for future reference and traceability, then clean up the working directories.

**Actions**:

1. Announce to the user that all tasks have been completed. Congratulate them.

2. Determine the archive directory name from the task name established in Phase 2. Sanitize it for use as a directory name (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces, no special characters). The archive path is: `docs/archives/<project-name>/`. See `references/templates/archive.md` for the target directory structure and index template.

3. Create the archive directory structure and move all artifacts into it:
   - Move `docs/analysis/` to `docs/archives/<project-name>/analysis/`
   - Move `docs/plan/` to `docs/archives/<project-name>/plan/`
   - Move `docs/progress/` to `docs/archives/<project-name>/progress/`
   - Move the project-level sub-SKILL file to `docs/archives/<project-name>/skill/SKILL.md`
   - Move any other temporary files generated during development into the archive

4. **[GitHub modes]** Close the GitHub Milestone for each phase (if not already closed). Optionally close the GitHub Project board. These resources remain accessible on GitHub as a permanent record.

5. Create or update the archive index file `docs/archives/README.md`:
   - If the file does not exist, create it with a header and the first project entry
   - If it already exists, append a new entry for this project
   - Each entry should include: project name, one-line description, date range (started — completed), link to the archived MASTER.md, and **[GitHub modes]** the GitHub Project URL

6. After archiving, remove the now-empty `docs/analysis/`, `docs/plan/`, and `docs/progress/` directories from the project root's `docs/` folder, and remove the sub-SKILL's original directory if it is now empty. Only `docs/archives/` should remain under `docs/`.

7. Suggest to the user that they might want to commit the archive to version control.

**Output**: All artifacts preserved under `docs/archives/<project-name>/`, with an updated index at `docs/archives/README.md`. In GitHub modes, Milestones and Issues remain as a permanent record on GitHub.

## Behavioral Rules

All rules in `references/behavioral-rules.md` apply to every phase. Read and follow them.
